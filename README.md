Fast track to Scala
===========

Code examples here are a base for my presentation to Java fellows. This presentation is about to show Scala in possibly 
fast way allowing you to get your hands dirty. There is no aim to cover everything extensively, but give enough to understand the concept.

Whilst working on it, I got an idea this code can be a good introduction for people coming to Scala from other languages,
that's why you will find short comments explaining the code.
It's hard to find such concise resources around the web so it's worthwhile to make one.
Maybe except cheat sheets but they are too short and you can't play with them!

Feel free to join forces, update code, add more things. We can talk at [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/leszekgruchala/scala-fast-track)
